## ðŸ§ª Day-1: Exploring Software Testing Tools & the Power of Documentation
Day-1 of Skill Lab introduced us to the core concepts of software testing and the importance of clear, organized documentation throughout the software development process. We started by learning why testing is critical to ensuring software performs well and meets quality standards. It was eye-opening to see how identifying bugs early on can save a lot of time and effort in the long run.

A major takeaway from the session was the role of documentation in testing. Itâ€™s not just about keeping records â€” itâ€™s about making collaboration smoother and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. We learned how creating detailed test cases, test plans, and keeping track of defects helps teams work more efficiently and provides a solid reference point for future work.

We also got our hands dirty with Zoho Test Automation tools. Through guided tutorials, we learned how to navigate the platform, create test cases, and manage data â€” giving us practical experience with tools that are commonly used in the industry.

By the end of the session, we had a better understanding of how testing workflows function, why documentation matters so much, and how to use some real-world testing tools to get the job done.
