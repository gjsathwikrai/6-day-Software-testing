On Day 2, we developed a personal portfolio website to showcase our skills, projects, and achievements.
The site features sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.
It has a clean, responsive design that works well on all devices.
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also integrated FastAPI for backend functionality.
FastAPI was used to handle contact form submissions and future API integrations.
The website includes smooth scrolling, animations, and a professional layout.
It serves as a platform for career growth, internships, and networking.
The project helped us enhance both frontend and backend development skills.
This was a collaborative effort carried out as part of our learning process.

we developed a simple Bug Reporting System to streamline issue tracking and management.
The system allows users to report software bugs with details like title, description, and severity.
We implemented a clean interface for submitting and viewing bug reports.
FastAPI was used to build the backend API for handling bug data and storing it securely.
The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth user experience.
Bug reports are displayed in a structured format for easy review and debugging.
This system is useful for developers to keep track of issues in their projects.
It helped us understand form handling, API integration, and CRUD operations.
The project focused on creating a functional and minimal bug tracking tool.
